Mathematical reasoning is the process of using logical thinking to solve problems and make decisions based on mathematical concepts. It involves analyzing patterns, making inferences, drawing conclusions, and justifying solutions. There are two main types of mathematical reasoning:

1. **Deductive reasoning**: Starting with general principles or known facts and applying them to specific cases to reach a conclusion. For example, using a theorem to prove a statement is true for all cases.
   
2. **Inductive reasoning**: Observing specific cases or patterns and making generalizations or predictions based on those observations.

Both forms of reasoning are essential in problem-solving, proofs, and understanding the relationships between different mathematical concepts.
