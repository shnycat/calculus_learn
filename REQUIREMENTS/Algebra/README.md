Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses symbols, letters, and numbers to represent and solve problems involving relationships and patterns. It allows us to express mathematical ideas in a general form, often using variables (like x and y) to represent unknown values.

### Key Concepts in Algebra:

1. **Variables**: Symbols that represent unknown quantities (e.g., x, y).
2. **Expressions**: Combinations of numbers, variables, and operations (e.g., 2x + 3).
3. **Equations**: Statements that two expressions are equal (e.g., 2x + 3 = 7).
4. **Functions**: Relationships between sets of inputs and outputs, often expressed as equations (e.g., y = 2x + 1).
5. **Polynomials**: Algebraic expressions that involve terms with variables raised to whole number exponents (e.g., 3x² + 2x - 5).

### Applications:
Algebra is used in various fields, including science, engineering, finance, and everyday problem-solving. It helps in modeling real-world situations, making predictions, and finding unknown values based on given information.

Overall, algebra serves as a foundational tool for more advanced mathematics and practical applications in everyday life.

### Overview
Let’s start with the basics of algebra, moving step by step with examples. I’ll explain each concept and provide examples for you to understand. 

### 1. **Variables and Expressions**

#### Explanation:
- In algebra, letters like \( x \), \( y \), or \( z \) are used to represent unknown values. These are called **variables**.
- An **expression** is a combination of variables, numbers, and operations (like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

#### Example:
- \( 2x + 3 \) is an algebraic expression where \( 2x \) means \( 2 \times x \), and you are adding 3.

If \( x = 5 \), we can evaluate the expression:
\[
2(5) + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13
\]

### 2. **Solving Simple Equations**

#### Explanation:
- An **equation** is a statement that two expressions are equal, and solving an equation means finding the value of the variable.

#### Example:
Solve \( x + 4 = 9 \)

- To solve, we need to get \( x \) by itself on one side of the equation.
- Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[
x + 4 - 4 = 9 - 4 \\
x = 5
\]
So, \( x = 5 \).

### 3. **Two-Step Equations**

#### Explanation:
- Sometimes, it takes two steps to solve for the variable.

#### Example:
Solve \( 3x - 5 = 10 \)

1. First, add 5 to both sides to get rid of the -5:
\[
3x - 5 + 5 = 10 + 5 \\
3x = 15
\]
2. Then, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
\[
\frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3} \\
x = 5
\]
So, \( x = 5 \).

### 4. **Simplifying Algebraic Expressions**

#### Explanation:
- To **simplify** an expression, combine like terms (terms that have the same variable to the same power).

#### Example:
Simplify \( 4x + 3x \)

- Since both terms have the same variable \( x \), add them together:
\[
4x + 3x = 7x
\]
So, the simplified expression is \( 7x \).

### 5. **Solving Inequalities**

#### Explanation:
- An **inequality** is like an equation, but instead of \( = \), you’ll see symbols like \( < \), \( > \), \( \leq \), or \( \geq \). The process of solving inequalities is similar to solving equations, but if you multiply or divide by a negative number, you must reverse the inequality symbol.

#### Example:
Solve \( 2x + 3 < 9 \)

1. Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[
2x + 3 - 3 < 9 - 3 \\
2x < 6
\]
2. Divide both sides by 2:
\[
\frac{2x}{2} < \frac{6}{2} \\
x < 3
\]
So, \( x \) is less than 3.

### 6. **Substitution**

#### Explanation:
- In algebra, you often **substitute** values for variables in expressions or equations to solve or simplify them.

#### Example:
Given \( y = 2x - 1 \), find \( y \) when \( x = 4 \).

- Substitute \( x = 4 \) into the equation:
\[
y = 2(4) - 1 \\
y = 8 - 1 = 7
\]
So, \( y = 7 \) when \( x = 4 \).

### 7. **Distributive Property**

#### Explanation:
- The **distributive property** allows you to multiply a number by a sum or difference inside parentheses.

#### Example:
Simplify \( 3(2x + 4) \)

- Use the distributive property:
\[
3(2x) + 3(4) = 6x + 12
\]
So, the simplified expression is \( 6x + 12 \).
