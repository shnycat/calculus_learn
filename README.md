Calculus is a branch of mathematics that studies change. It's divided into two main parts: **differential calculus** and **integral calculus**.

- **Differential calculus** focuses on finding the rate of change of a quantity, like speed or slope, which is represented by the derivative. It answers questions like, "How fast is something changing at this moment?" For example, it can help calculate the speed of a car at a specific time based on its position over time.

- **Integral calculus** is concerned with accumulation, like finding the total area under a curve or the total distance traveled by an object over a period of time. It deals with integrals, which can be thought of as the opposite of derivatives.

Together, these concepts help solve real-world problems in physics, engineering, economics, and other fields by analyzing motion, growth, and change.
